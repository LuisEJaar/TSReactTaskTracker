# TSReactTaskTracker

This project was mainly done by following the guidance of React & TypeScript - Course for Beginners by FreeCodeCamp. Upon completion of this tutorial I then took the oportunity to add localstorage to this project in order to practice this for the first time. I also took the opportunity to learn how to host react apps on github-pages as heroku is ending their free feature in the near future of me finishing this project.
